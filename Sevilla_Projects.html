                                                        Our first project in CSE this year, was a scratch project.
                                                        We were able to make a story, or a game. My pal Jot and I, made a game.
                                                        The game had to be made in various different styles.
                                                        A storyline, or levels for increasing difficulty, with an ending/a win.
                                                        This game is a "Mario Sprited" reflex game, with only 2 main controls, which are the left and right arrow keys (there's a third which is the jump button,
                                                        but it's a bit buggy). There is a red koopa shell sprite, that follows you in progressive levels. To beat a level, you must collect a star that appears
                                                        after about 5 seconds, and after level 1,
                                                        there are 2 choices. A left and a right. The right side leads to level 2, a much more faster red koopa shell.
                                                        Then there's the boss battle on the left side. Almost impossible to beat, and also buggy.
                                                        I was sick for 3 important days of work, so Jot had done most of the beta and final, so I'm giving most of the credit to him.
                                                        Before and after I had been sick, we had come up with the Mario concept, and I found workable sprites with different costumes.
                                                        I think it's pretty good for a first game, but there are better ones with better concepts.

                                                        Our second project in CSE this year, was an app project.
                                                        We were given default apps to choose from and expand ideas on them to make them better.
                                                        My partner Ryley and I, made a "Photobooth" app. Me, knowing the knowledge of using Mit App Inventor already,
                                                        plus doing something like the project we chose, it was simple to add things, but I still had learned more and added more.
                                                        Ryley gave me ideas and feedback to change with the app, and caught mistakes I had made when blocking it together and
                                                        making the app aesthetically pleasing. It's a simple picture app that you can draw on, and save (for some reason it doesn't save the picture with the drawing).
                                                        With a pen size slider to change the size. There are different colors to choose from, but not a lot of variety.
                                                        The actually works pretty well, but with a lot of restrictions in the program, it is pretty buggy and glitchy.
                                                        Here's an <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By21k0X51YhhQ0dRdDdGUUFNbTg/view?usp=sharing">APK file</a></b> of the app.

                                                        Our fifth project in CSE this year, was our third Python project.
                                                        We were given 4 different types of clients to manipulate images to.
                                                        For example, we did Client #3; A Product. My partner Rafe and I did Gosling Shampoo.
                                                        We accidentally spent about 2-3 days of the project trying to manipulate multiple Ryan Gosling photos
                                                        to create the first photo that I just made on Photoshop myself. Right after we got back on track, I was
                                                        playing around with the RGBA values for the curves on the images, and I found some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11142851/adding-borders-to-an-image-using-python">border code</a>
                                                        and changed it in the slightest. More than halfway through the project I realized you had to run the code from one line,
                                                        and in the end I couldn't get it to work with one line. I had to change multiple file names manually.
                                                        JPG photos didn't work well with transparent photos, so I used PNG; for convenience reasons.
                                                        The last couple days, I just added some "Watermark Text," and the text on the top left on the borders say
                                                        "Gosling Shampoo Inc".  In the end, I never contacted Ryan Gosling or Johnson Shampoo.
